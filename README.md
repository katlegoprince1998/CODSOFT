# CODSOFT
This repository will contain all the projects I develop during the CodSoft internship. There will be a total of five projects.

Task 1 (Number Game)

Here's a glimpse of the requirements I nailed:

âœ… Generated random numbers within a specified range.

âœ… Prompted users to guess the generated number.

âœ… Provided accurate feedback on guesses (correct, too high, or too low).

âœ… Limited user attempts for each round.

âœ… Added the option for multiple rounds to keep the fun going.

âœ… Displayed user scores based on attempts taken or rounds won.

But here's the twist! ðŸ”„ I spiced things up by incorporating a dynamic scoring system. Users kick off with 5 attempts. As they miss guesses, attempts decrease, and points drop by 5. Yet, hitting the correct guess rewards users with a cool 10 points, which can accumulate with each successive win.
